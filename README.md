# SpeckleSIM
Open Source Versatile Superresolution Microscopy

# Principle and Setup
please read before materials and methods here:

# SLM phase generation pattern
- Binary Phase Mask Harmonic pattern for classical SIM
- Binary Phase mask For Rayleigh Statistics Speckle illumination
- Binary Phase mask for Non Rayleigh Statistics Speckle illumination
- Real time Optimization of SIM and Speckle illumination Based on Gerberg_Saxton algorithm

# Sequence generation on QXGA FPGA 
- sequence generation for fast SIM application
- Sequence generation for Speckle superresolution application

# Acquiring triggering and acquisition Code
- triggering with arduino solution or labview :  Laser, SLM, Piezo Electric stage and SCMOS camera synchronization.
- Live superresolution setting and script file for micromanager.

# Reconstruction code
- classical SIM reconstruction Methods
- Separate deconvolution methods based on speckle illumination
